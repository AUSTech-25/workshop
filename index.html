    <h2>Scope of Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        Oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface, yet much of the underwater domain remains unexplored. Effective surveillance is essential for environmental protection, security, and industrial monitoring. Core objectives include preserving marine ecosystems, monitoring fisheries, detecting aquatic diseases, and preventing illegal activities. Automated systems with advanced imaging and sensors support continuous coastal monitoring by identifying anomalies through audio and video data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Underwater communication has advanced significantly, enabling data exchange between submerged vehicles, sensors, and surface stations. Challenges such as signal attenuation and scattering affect both optical and acoustic data quality. This workshop will explore recent developments in underwater vision, sensor fusion, AI-based analytics, and communication technologies. Topics include deep learning for image enhancement, generative models for data augmentation, autonomous underwater vehicles, and acoustic communication protocols. The workshop aims to connect researchers and industry experts to drive innovation in underwater surveillance.
